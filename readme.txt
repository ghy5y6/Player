"bass.dll" goes in 2 places: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\bin" (it will ask you to replace it, just replace it)

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod

"gmcl_musicplayer_win64.dll" goes in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\bin" (if "bin" doesnt exist make the folder)

(you need x86-x64 bit branch, to switch to it, go to steam, right click on gmod, go to properties, and go to beta, switch to that branch, make sure x64 is checked when you launch gmod)
